  <h1>Postdoctoral position in Bioinformatics </h1>
  <p>
  Two post-doctoral positions are available in Dr. Zechen Chong’s Laboratory (https://sites.uab.edu/chonglab) in the Informatics Institute and Department of Genetics, at the School of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham. We are seeking passionate and motivated Bioinformatics geeks to join the team. Currently, we are actively working on nationwide and local (disease) genomics projects, including the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC), All of Us, Alabama Genomic Health Initiative (HGHI), Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed), South-seq, etc. The positions are for 2-3 years with possible extensions. The project will depend on the interests and abilities of the applicant. Our projects mainly fall into two categories: one is the development of efficient algorithms/tools for analyzing different types of sequencing data from third-generation sequencing platforms such as PacBio and Nanopore; the other is the application of the tools to perform hypothesis-driven data analysis. 
  </p>

  <h2>Ideal candidates would be</h2>
  <p>
  Ph.D. in genomics, bioinformatics, computer science, cloud computing, physics, mathematics, genetics, etc. with a general background in computational biology.
  </p>
  <p>
  Strong skills in algorithm design and data analysis, experience in next-generation and/or third-generation sequencing data is a plus.
  </p>
  <p>
  Demonstrated related research achievements.
